# Image-Processing-Gender-Prediction-Model

I have use Artificial Neural Network(ANN) using deep learning techniquest to predict the gender of the person in the image.

I have used OpenCV library for image processing:
To normalize the imput date
1) Detected and sliced the face of the person in the image
2) Converted the images to grayscale
3) Reshaped the images to 48 x 48 input size

Model is trained on 5 hidden layers with 1,102,902 Trainable parameters

Gender prediction models can be utilized in various real-time applications, including:

Marketing and Advertising: Tailoring ads based on predicted gender to enhance engagement and conversion rates.

Social Media Platforms: Enhancing user experience by personalizing content and recommendations based on gender insights.

E-commerce: Customizing product recommendations and marketing strategies to target different gender demographics effectively.

Customer Support: Adapting communication styles and responses in chatbots based on the predicted gender of users.

Content Moderation: Filtering or categorizing user-generated content according to gender-related norms and sensitivities.

Healthcare: Analyzing health-related trends and behaviors among different genders for better service delivery.

Gaming: Personalizing in-game experiences or matchmaking based on user demographics, including gender.

Event Planning: Customizing experiences or marketing for events based on the predicted gender of attendees.
